# FindNearestRestaurant
A project for Foundations of Computing subject, that calculates distances between points on a 2D graph ("restaurants").

This code takes in a city in the form of a 2D grid as an input. 
Each grid has 2 restaurants. From a certain point in the city, the program will then find the restaurants that are within a certain distance from the certain point in the city.

The distance is calculated using Euclidean distance.

### Infestation
Infestation (**infestation.py**) is the extended version of the program, it returns a list of the restaurants that are within certain distance from a list of epicenters.
